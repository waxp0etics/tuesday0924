#Hello Everyone!

I just wanted to introduce myself since the Bio section has limited characters.
I'm a writer and film photographer currently taking an introductory web design course. 
My goal is to expand my horizons by combining my creativity and technical skills to 
build and maintain web pages and create new opportunities for myself in the digital world. 
I would like to build a new portfolio site for my photography and 
interactive sites for future films I work on, 
so I don't have to outsource the work. 
In doing so, I hope to gain the skills necessary to build websites for clients also 
working in the creative space.
